Module: DBIx::Ease

Description:
    DBIx::Ease is intended to allow less-code DBI interactions. Version 0.01
    works with DBD::CSV. exec() takes currently two arguments, the path 'f_dir'
    and a SQL statement. exec() handles connects or reuse of connections,
    prepare, execute and returns an array of all selected rows for SELECTs.

    DBIx::Ease is currently in pre-alpha; rather a prototype.
    
Synopsis:
    use DBIx::Ease;

    my $csv_cons = new DBIx::Ease('CSV');

    $csv_cons->exec(
       "databasename",      # using CSV this is the path
       "DELETE from somename where i=1");

    my @results = $csv_cons->exec("databasename","SELECT ..");

    $csv_cons->disconnect_all;
