Module: DBIx::Ease

Synopsis:
    use DBIx::Ease;

    my $cons = new DBIx::Ease('DBI:mysql:<databasename>');

    $cons->exec(
       "databasename",
       "DELETE FROM somename WHERE i=1", "user", "password");

    my @results = $cons->exec("databasename","SELECT ..");

    $cons->disconnect_all;

Description:
    DBIx::Ease is intended to allow less-code DBI interactions. Version 0.06
    works with any driver, but still supports the use of DBD::CSV.

    Upon creation of a new DBIx::Ease object you should pass the portion
    of the DSN (Data Source Name) common to all connections the object is
    supposed to store. Replace the variable portions with '<databasename>'.
    Whenever you wish to make only one connection you may enter the complete
    DSN, also when you want to make connections with the same source but as 
    different users, then call exec() with different names of your choice as  
    initial argument.
     
    exec() takes the portion of the DSN which has been kept variable as its
    first argument or a connection name of your choice if a complete DSN was 
    entered when creating the object. exec() automatically reuses established 
    connections.

    Any SQL statement is the second argument; exec() returns an array with all 
    selected values/rows for SELECTs.
    
    User name and password are optional third and fourth arguments to exec() to
    use where new connections are established and stored in the object.

    Calling disconnect_all() will close all connections with the calling object.

    DBIx::Ease is intentionally designed not to exit on errors, unless you use
    RaiseError.
